\begin{itemize}
    % The main research challenges tackled by the paper
    \item This paper tackles the problem of Offline Reinforcement Learning.
    % The high-level technical insights into the problem of interest
    \item Offline Reinforcement Learning is a approach which learns from collected dataset and without interacting with the environment.
    % The main contributions of the paper (compared to the prior works)
    \item The authors proposed a new algorithm called Implicit Q-Learning, proved that it has good convergence properties. \cite{2110.06169}
    \item Implicit Q-Learning is a multi-step dynamic programming algorithm, and it avoids querying the out-of-distribution actions. With additional policy extraction step, it can recover near-optimal policies in the offline setting. 
    % Your personal perspective on the proposed method
    \item In my opinion, they used some elegant and simple formulas to build up this algorithm. Though they induced more parameters, but the overall algorithm is still easy to implement.
